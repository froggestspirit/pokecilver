; Sweet Honey is a feature that was scrapped before development.
; It was later implemented in Pok√©mon Diamond and Pearl.
;
; Sweet Honey was probably reworked into Sweet Scent.
; A map in the final game has a Butterfree and a woman who gives
; the Sweet Scent TM.

; Most of these texts seem to be associated with a single NPC.
; The last text is associated with a second NPC, probably a Butterfree.
